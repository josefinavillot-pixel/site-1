				Everyday makeup is a natural, minimal makeup style that enhances features without looking overdone, using a few essential products like tinted moisturizer or light foundation, concealer, blush, mascara, and a neutral lip product. The goal is to create a polished, confident, and fresh look for daily wear, prioritizing simplicity, speed, and blending for a seamless finish.
